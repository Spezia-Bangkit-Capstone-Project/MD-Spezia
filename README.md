# Spezia
This repository is a repository for the Spezia application which is an image recognition-based application that is useful for recognizing the spices present and then providing a description of the spices. 
By scanning or taking photos of spices, users can find out the types and descriptions of spices. In addition, users are also given information about the use of these ingredients as herbal medicines and what kind of food processing can be served using these ingredients.

This application project is part of the **[Capstone Project - Bangkit Academy 2022](https://grow.google/intl/id_id/bangkit/)** which is a collaboration between the fields of **Mobile Development, Cloud Computing, and Machine Learning.**
